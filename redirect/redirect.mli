(** [read_and_close chan f] evaluates [f ()], then closes [chan]

    [chan] is close even if [f] raises an exception.
    The difference between [read_and_close chan f] and

    is that if [f ()] succeeds and [close_in chan] raises an exception,
    this exception is not intercepted, and if [f ()] raises an exception,
    then [close_in_noerr] is used so that the exception raised by [f ()]
    is not masked.

    The difference between [write_and_close chan f] and

    is that if [f ()] succeeds and [close_out chan] raises an exception,
    this exception is not intercepted, and if [f ()] raises an exception,

    file for reading as [channel], and evaluates [f filename channel].
    Once [f] returns or raises an exception, [channel] is closed and the file
